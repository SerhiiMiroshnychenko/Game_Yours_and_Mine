# Game_Yours_and_Mine
This pet project in which I will be developing a strategic war game in Yours and Mine.

In the folder game_ver_1 there is a working old version of the game.
You can play it by running the game_ver_1.py file.

In the folder game_ver_2 there is a new version of the game using classes.
It cannot be played yet. It is still under development.

Sincerely, Serhii Miroshnychenko.
